While in Qatar, I came accross Jacks Moral Wall. As I saw service members rotate in, I thought wouldn't it be great for everyone who was returning from their deployment if they had a place to go to get suggestions of the best places to relax when they got home. A place that highlighted what they missed in the last 6 months, that showed what the newest IPAs are, a place that helped them catch up on great food, and most importanly a place to find good company. This is the beggining of a simpler life here at Simple Jacks.
